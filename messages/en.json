      "1": {
        "q": "How is this different from asking ChatGPT?",
        "a": "ChatGPT gives generic answers with no sources and can't keep up with France's constantly changing regulations. AccueilAI analyzes CESEDA law, service-public.gouv.fr, and official CAF/CPAM documentation in real time — every answer includes source links. We also accumulate real user experience data, so we reflect not just what the law says, but how things actually work in practice."

      },
      "3": {
        "q": "How accurate is the AI?",
        "a": "Every answer includes the source link so you can verify. When the AI isn't confident, it tells you — and suggests consulting a professional. We never guess."
