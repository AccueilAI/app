        "q": "How is this different from asking ChatGPT?",

AccueilAI analyzes CESEDA law, service-public.gouv.fr, and official CAF/CPAM documentation in real time — every answer includes source links. We also accumulate real user experience data, so we reflect not just what the law says, but how things actually work in practice."

      "3": {
        "q": "How accurate is the AI?",
