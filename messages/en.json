        "a": "No. AccueilAI is an information tool that helps you understand French administrative procedures using official government data. For complex legal situations, we always recommend consulting a qualified immigration lawyer."
      },
      "1": {
        "q": "How is this different from asking ChatGPT?",
        "a": "ChatGPT gives generic answers with no sources and can't keep up with France's constantly changing regulations. AccueilAI analyzes CESEDA law, service-public.gouv.fr, and official CAF/CPAM documentation in real time — every answer includes source links. We also accumulate real user experience data, so we reflect not just what the law says, but how things actually work in practice."

      "2": {
        "q": "What topics do you cover?",
        "a": "Visa & residency (VLS-TS, titre de séjour, APS, Talent Passport), housing (rental contracts, deposits, justificatif de domicile), financial aid (CAF — APL/ALS/ALF, RSA, Prime d'activité), healthcare (CPAM, Carte Vitale, Mutuelle), taxes (first declaration, numéro fiscal, double taxation), telecom & utilities, freelance & business (auto-entrepreneur, SIRET, URSSAF), banking, daily life (driver's license exchange, vehicle registration), and nationality acquisition."
      },
      "3": {
        "q": "How accurate is the AI?",
        "a": "Every answer includes the source link so you can verify. When the AI isn't confident, it tells you — and suggests consulting a professional. We never guess."
      },
      "4": {
        "q": "Which languages are supported?",
        "a": "English, French, and Korean at launch. More languages coming based on demand."
      },
      "5": {
        "q": "How current is the information?",
        "a": "Our database is continuously updated from official sources — CESEDA legislation, service-public.gouv.fr, CAF, CPAM, and tax authority publications. When laws change or procedures are updated, we reflect those changes and notify affected users. Every answer includes the source date so you can see exactly how recent it is."
